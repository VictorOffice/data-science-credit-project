# World Bank Economic Data Analysis and GDP Prediction

## Motivation
Analyze World Bank indicators (2000–2020) to understand drivers of GDP per capita and build a predictive model.

## Questions
1. Which indicators are most correlated with GDP per capita?
2. How did GDP per capita evolve across regions (2000–2020)?
3. Can we predict GDP per capita with ML?

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks.
- `src/` — Helper functions.
- `data/` — Local data cache (not tracked).
- `images/` — Figures.
- `requirements.txt`, `README.md`.

## Libraries Used
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, wbgapi, joblib

## Summary of Results
