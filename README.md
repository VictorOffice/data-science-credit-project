# World Bank Economic Data Analysis and GDP Prediction

## Motivation
Analyze World Bank indicators (2000–2020) to understand the main drivers of GDP per capita and build a simple predictive model for stakeholder decision-making and scenario planning.

## Questions
1. Which indicators are most correlated with GDP per capita?
2. How has GDP per capita evolved across regions (2000–2020)?
3. Can we predict GDP per capita using a simple ML model?

## Summary of Results
- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
- **Performance:** **R² = 0.941**, **RMSE ≈ \$4,971**  
- **Key Drivers (EDA):** Life expectancy and energy use per capita show the strongest positive correlations with GDP per capita, while export share also contributes positively. Population has a weak or negative relationship, as expected for a per-capita measure.  
- **Scenario Prediction:** For a hypothetical country with  
  - life_expectancy = 75.0  
  - energy_use_per_capita = 2000  
  - exports_gdp_pct = 35.0  
  - imports_gdp_pct = 30.0  
  - population = 20,000,000  
  The predicted **GDP per capita ≈ \$7,949.10**.
